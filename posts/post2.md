Major has a special place in my heart as one of the best sports anime out there. It’s not just about baseball—it’s about Goro Honda’s relentless spirit, the battles he faces on and off the field, and his journey to become the best. Watching Goro overcome injury, loss, and countless setbacks, all while holding onto his love for the game, makes every episode inspiring and intense. Major perfectly balances action with deep character growth, making it more than a typical sports story; it’s a testament to resilience and passion.
