I recently dived into No, I’m Not a Human, a game that blurs the lines between instinct and judgment. In it, the player becomes a gatekeeper, tasked with identifying "visitors" hiding among human guests. Each day brings a new rulebook of creepy tells: perfectly white teeth, dirty fingernails, bloodshot eyes, and blurred photos—small details that reveal who’s human and who’s a threat.

The tension builds as you interact with each guest, scanning for these eerie signals while trying to preserve energy and sanity. Every wrong choice has consequences; letting a "visitor" in means putting real humans in danger, while ignoring guests or lying about it brings the wrath of an "Intruder." Even the smallest mistake can be game over.

This gameplay feels like a twisted form of hospitality mixed with survival. There’s something unsettling about watching for signs and deciding someone’s fate with just a glance—and the growling noises visitors make don't help. The game explores a unique blend of strategy and paranoia.

No, I'm Not a Human isn’t just about who you let in but about the cost of survival in a world where one bad choice can lead to disaster. For anyone into psychological horror, this game is worth a try.
